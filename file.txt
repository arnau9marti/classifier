LioNets on Time Series (LioNets technique applied to the Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation dataset) LioNets is a methodology on providing explanations for a neural networks decisions, in a local scope, through a process that actively takes into consideration the neural networks architecture on creating an instances neighbourhood, that assures the adjacency among the generated neighbours and the instance. LioNets first presented in the Asset: “LioNets: Local Interpretations Of Neural Networks through Penultimate Layer Decoding” (https://www.ai4eu.eu/resource/lionets-local-interpretations-neural-networks-through-penultimate-layer-decoding) In this asset, the code of LioNets (v2.0) is supporting two python notebooks, which present two ways to interpret a binary classifier and a remaining useful lifetime predictor on the Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Dataset (https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/Turbofan-engine-degradation-simulation-data-set/vrks-gjie). This work is an essential setup, to be prepared for the AI4Robotics dataset. When this dataset is to be published, it will also be adapted to the exact same methodology presented in this asset.
